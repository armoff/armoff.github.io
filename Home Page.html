    <h3>Setting</h3>
 
 <p>
 I am serving in a modest farming town in the Alotro Mangoro region in Madagascar. It has a decent market on Saturdays where one can but kittens, small solar pannels, seasonal farm to table food, and meat stamped with the local vet's green seal of approval. Most people farm rice in paddies. There are so many children, I am not used to it.</br></br> This region used to be covered in rainforests, but those were felled for farms and fuel; Some people remeber that even 10 years ago there were plenty more trees (primarily eucalyptus plantations courtesy of Govt. "re-forestation" campaigns). The lemurs were eaten or displaced to pockets of protected land. I am helping a few folks improve their charcoal production so that they can produce the same amount with less wood (to decrease the pressure on the remaining trees), and smoke (which blankets the country during the drier months and is hellish). </br>
 </br>
 I eat lots of beans, fried rice dough for breakfast, and have been making as much furniture I can from hand sawn wood from the hill-people (they cut their trunks into planks with massive two person hand-saws). I use no nails and only handtools because I have lots of free time. I collect, drink, and bathe in rainwater; it is so cold.</br>
 </br>
  I also read about 20 books a month, so am always keen on recommendations of ALL sorts (no topic is too arcane if it is well written). </br>

    <h3>Peace Corps Mission</h3>
    <p>Allow me to remind you of the three (+) aims of the PC: </br>
    </p>
    <p>
    ONE: Help out around the country when asked, </br>
    TWO: be positive (about the USA),</br>
    THREE: tell folks in the USA about the country you serve in with an unbiased eye. </br>
    Bonus fourth g: get a pipeline of foreign service candidates for very few $</br>  </p>
