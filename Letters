   Hello Friend,
 <p>
When you read this I will already be somewhere over the Atlantic, or the Indian Ocean. Just where I can’t tell you as it would contravene the Peace Corps policy of never disclosing my location. For safety purposes. Let it be known that I take safety seriously. </p>


 <p>
Time slips by so quickly, I had allotted all the hours and now they are spent. <p>
 <p>
And yet here I am champing at the bit to start. </p>
 <p>
Have I started yet?
 </p>
  <p>
Yesterday I was having a very quick dinner at a Mexican restaurant across the 10 lane highway separating Crystal city from mainland Virginia, and upon opening a proffered bottle of green sauce found that it was quite fermented. The pressure was like that of a soda bottle: unscrewing it let off a pressure relieving psccht, encouraging me to remove the cap fully. Just like with soda, aural appearances can mislead: there was still plenty of pressure in the 4 ounce bottle. It erupted. I was sauced, leaving an Eric shaped outline on the wall behind me like a Lascaux cave painting. </p>
 <p>
I Had 10 minutes till the first Peace Corps even started, and yet to start on my lentil and avocado soup. </p>
 <p>
Simultaneously the patron next to me had forgotten their sweater on the way back to the Hilton, and Samaritan that I am, I took it to her, catching her up on the island between lanes 5 and 6. She thanked me (while witnessing her sister’s wedding’s parental speech on her phone) and informed me of the greenery gracing some of the more recessed areas of my physique. Alex is in my Peace Corps cohort. </p>


                 
 <p>
Crystal City is a strange place to be, as a good deal of the pedestrian real estate is below ground. At its opening in the 80’s, it was heralded as an […] “experiment” (in car-centric design). Quite so, and it has birthed generations of moles-cum-defense contractors, and soon, Amazons. Strange place to set out from for a stint promoting world peace and friendship in a country devoid of the ubiquitous carness so grossly here displayed. </p>
 <p>
Alone, tonight, I ate chickpeas bought from an Afghani collective. The patrons were from all ethnicities and walks of life; the walls were covered in patriotic stickers extolling the virtues of farming and black lives, Afghani and American flags. In my suite overlooking the neighboring high rise’s parking-top pool it struck me that, in fact, Crystal city was a perfect place to start my trip from. Those images of the protean America one can’t know without being there are the first thing I want to share with the Malagasy. </p>


 <p>
 Thank you and please spare a thought for this poor soul during the 20-some hour flight I am currently on :( </p>

   <p><h3><u>ETY First Impressions</h3></u></p>
    <a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
<p>    9/10/22
</p>  
<p>
Please note that this email was written last week and I was not able to send it till now... Something wrong with who knows what...
</p>
<p>
Hello again!
</p><p>
I have arrived in Madagascar after a long flight. A very long flight. And now, resting.
</p><p>

Please read the following disclaimer: the impressions below are MY OWN (not that of the USA Govt.) and should not be considered as any form of official communication. Please do not post this to a public/online space as there are considerable, and even political, ramifications that could lead to sticky-icy ends.
</p><p>

So.
</p>
<p>
Some fellow told Lafcadio Hearn that he should immediately collect his first impressions on arriving in Japan (in 1860-something) so that he could reflect on them post- getting to know the country and see how his naive understanding had evolved. That dummy didn’t do it! But I learned from his mistakes and so here are a few of the first impressions that I made upon stepping out of Tana Airport a few days ago:
</p>
<p>
A little child running between two rows of speeding (and abruptly stopping) cars, begging; an older version of the previous, in a wheelchair at a stoplight begging with a butterfly net so that a Samaritan could lob coins at him with accuracy (note: coins are worth several fractions of a USA Cent).
</p>
<p>
Cars and mopeds behaving like schooling fish or flocks of birds. Those animals have been observed to keep two or more of their colleagues in direct line of sight, and in so doing prevent collisions mid flight/swim, yet giving rise to anarchic systems with no one leader or discernible pattern; the malagasy pilots (for none are certified drivers, Madagascar having not delivered any licenses since before most have been born) do the same, and despite numerous opportunities to whack a pedestrian or smoosh a cyclist, I have not witnessed any road deaths (so far). Those two latter categories observe the same “rules” as the pilots, though being slower, don’t have any rights, and so dart into traffic only when there is sufficient space or slowed vehicles (which happens every few feet in Tana traffic; note, no stoplights in Madagascar, merely prudish yields that rarely show their face). They are often alerted of imminent danger with cheery chirps from those that would visit death upon them should they step out of line.
</p>
<p>
Tana has many hills, good for adding tension to a town, and good for break-rotor-repairmen. Cyclists are Tour-De-France hill climb contenders, and must have very oak-like thighs but black lungs. The air in Tana is thick with the smoke of dinner fires and the oily, noxious fumes of the aging vehicle fleet kept alive in the many roadside stalls ministering the ailing mechanic flock.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of black lung, the USA government requires PC covid prevention through constant mask wearing, but the main reason any of us wear masks is to protect from the aforementioned fumes.
</p>
<p>
There are two tunnels, and they are dantesque: pitch dark (besides from the light filtering in from either end), smoky, and filled, as like hell, with pretty much everyone known. The headlights of our clean, white Toyata 4 Runner made literal cones, illuminating the 6 inches of sidewalk that commuters were using to cross town to get to work.
</p>
<p>
There are some sleek, lithe, well fed cats that slink around with shimmering coats, likely due to a diet high in rodent based vitamins (good for hair I hear).
</p>
<p>
I was hoping to come to MG with a certain idea of escaping USA car-centric design and culture (Parking politics and such) but whoa baby, Madagascar has a lot of cars, despite so few roads to use them on. Actually, Madagascar probably has few cars, but since there are so few practicable roads, all the cars in creation tend to find themselves in the same place at the same time. Any road out of town is a constant stream of 18 wheelers delivering flammable toxic fluids (advertised in chilling symbolism on their sides) that our MG drivers make a point of passing with upmost haste, sometimes making use of landscape I would have considered reserved for pedestrians, but is in fact reserved for no one (or rather are commons reserved for use by all).
</p>
<p>
Our driver was the fastest, which directly translates to most skilled; and even with a pee stop on the side of the road we arrived to Mantasoa first by a country mile, or a Madagascar minute (which means nothing, but is longer than a New York one). His driving skill quelled my fear of flying off a cliff during passing maneuvers on the washboard/pot hole areas (PC cars are superior to most other vehicles on the road, especially in those zones, making these zones prime passing spots).
<p>
</p>
This may sound a bit overwhelming, and it is, but it also is incredibly fun, mainly thanks to the good spirit of the Peace Corps staff, both volunteers and full time employees who I may describe at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Until next time,
</p>
<p>
Velooma!
</p>

   <p><u><h3>Host Families</h3></u></p>
    <a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
    <p>9/17/22
</p>
<p>
There are good home stay families and better home stay families.
</p>
<p>
I think that I have had some of the best luck of the 22 volunteers in our group and certainly am enjoying myself. For one, the food is good. More on this in another email, but: it did take a few meals to get used to, as certain ingredients have more pronounced tastes (the meat especially), and there are some recognizable ingredients used in novel ways (such as peanut pumpkin stew).
</p>
<p>
It may not be as edifying as some of the others, who are getting the full taste and smell of the Malagasy experience, but in it’s own way I am certainly in the biggest house (Trano-Be, “be” being big).
</p>
<p>
My host parents are Pierre and Lalane, and they run various projects with the generic drug importer that he used to work for (for him), and operates a small white and teal pharmacy at the base of their terraced gardens (for her). The gardens smell of jasmine and eucalyptus, and the wind shimmers the leaves. From the hilltop there is a beautiful view during morning coffee and Sunday lunch (a royal affair).
</p>
<p>
Their two sons being in Tana means that they are quite happy to devote considerable attention on me, be it teaching Malagasy with gusto, or cooking delicious meals over the wood fire that gives all cooking a pleasantly smoky depth.
</p>
<p>
My room is big and faces east over a few small banana trees, and when the power cuts out I can still enjoy a warm indoor shower by romantic candlelight.
</p>
<p>
Yow.
</p>
<p>
This contrasts considerably with Rose, who lives at the bottom of my hill, in a ditch.
</p>
<p>
Her half-dozen barefoot host children run to meet her everyday after lessons and escort her through the throng of men that crowd in the pool hall that her parents run in the back room (where she is not allowed to enter, though attempting to do so would be such a departure from common sense that it would indicate a malaria delirium, or similar ailment of concern) and the throngs milling about an empty shop selling nothing visible. They quickly open, enter, and just as quickly shut the front gate; such assiduousness is not necessary when entering the house as there is no door (actually, a rickety shutter serves as an after dark precaution, it is cast aside during the day, and Rose only noticed it recently).
</p>
<p>
Upon entering, she sees the kitchen; panning right, a tarp wall; another tarp wall; a cloth wall that encloses two child sized beds pushed together. Continuing, she comes to the living room, with two dubious couches and a raised platform that, when pushed together, serve as a resting place for the rest of the population not slept in the aforementioned beds.
</p>
<p>
The mud and brick walls continue to a breezeway and a small (kely) door that leads to the second story where Rose lodges. Up a small ladder and into bed!
</p>
<p>
Though not immediately: the whole family, after finishing dinner informes Rose that she is tired and ushers her to the kely door and ladder behind. As they wave her up, she ascends too embarrassed to lock the door to their face (peace corps requirement), and so, a few minutes later, descends to do so after family dispersal.
</p>
<p>
Although in some Malagasy houses one is worried about indoor air pollution from cooking fires or notorious smokers, Rose does not face any such issues as there are decent drafts. Additionally, the roof above her is a double layer of tarp that glows blue-ly in the full moon’s light. Drawback: when it rains, as it has been doing a decent amount in the past week, she is soggy. Fortunately the sun has come out as the spring is nearing, hopefully the rainy season will not start before she has time to dry out at least once!
</p>
<p>
As in many countries, roofs serve as floors to creatures unshackled by human strictures, and so it is with Rose’s situation. Nightly, a good-sized animal wedges itself between the tarp layers and scootches across the width of the room. Why between and not on is still unclear.
</p>
<p>
It would be easier to identify if the electricity were more reliable. Unfortunately for science, Rose has not yet managed to illuminate the being quickly enough to identify it definitively, but suspects (hopes) that it is a cat.
</p>
<p>
When the power cuts out Rose is fortunate enough to count on the solicitude of her downstairs neighbors (living on the couches) who hand her up a flashlight through the hole next to her bed, but this is not practical for rapid nocturnal species identification.
</p>
<p>
That hole also transmits their gentle night-time breathing and snores. It is about the size of a chamber pot.
</p>
<p>
I live below my host parents and there are no holes allowing for easy communication between floors asides from a conventional staircase on the other side of the house.
</p>
<p>
Though don’t think for one moment that all is hardship!
</p><p>
There are several silver linings to such a rustic situation: all have to do with plumbing (or rather what would be plumbing if there were pipes).
</p>
<p>
All volunteers were issued a chamber pot given that venturing outdoors after dark to use the kaboonet (cabinet/outhouse) would open one up to witch-abduction (local lore) or a stubbed toe/trodden-on chicken. It also serves to measure hole dimensions. We were asked to follow customary practices and deposit chamber pot contents into the outhouse first thing upon waking (which is about 5am by Malagasy reckoning). Rose is spared a treacherous ladder descent and the ignominy of traipsing though shared space because she can reach the outhouse roof from her window! She merely deposits the pot there, strolls down, and to the great surprise of her family informs them that no, she has already taken care of business, than you very much!
</p>
<p>
Additionally, that same window is where the family suggested she wash face and brush teeth. In the morning hours all and sundry wish her a jolly good morning or a “hello Rosie!” There are few better ways to become a fixture of the town by showing such a public face! I will never reach her levels of local notoriety as I use an indoor bathroom.
</p>
<p>
It all builds character, yaknow.
</p>
<p>
Well,
</p>
<p>
I hope this reaches you all well,
</p><p>
Thank you,
</p>
<p>
After I wrote this Rose managed to catch the creature on video: as suspected and hoped for, a cat (Saka). She showed me the video, like she did her host mother. This latter said “no problem!” presumably hoping to reassure Rose that her concern for the structural integrity of the house was not jeopardized by a mere cat, not, as Rose was actually worried about: a wild cat inches from her head nightly. No solutions offered (as no problem detected by homeowner), ergo: assiduous moz. net tucking.

   <p>9/26/22</p>
   <p>
    Dear Friends,
</p><p>
I am writing this by candlelight, with a bowl full of dirt on my desk.
</p>
<p>
Can you guess what is in the bowl?
</p>
<p>
Go ahead, take your time. What do you know about me and/or dirt receptacles?
</p>
<p>
That’s right!
</p>
<p>
Three c h a m e l e o n eggs !
</p>
<p>
I am currently learning about the agriculture work that I am to do and promote in Madagascar (see “feed the future” on the USAID website to get an idea). To do so I shadowed a farmer on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
The farmer that I worked with spotted the eggs while we were clearing brush and said that if you plant them like seeds (which they resemble, being bean sized-saped-colored) they will sprout lizards in as little as five days.
</p>
<p>
I must confess that one of the things I was hoping to see most was a chameleon, even more than the better known lemurs, and here I am gazing a bowl of dirt from whence those swivel-eyed-air-eaters will hopefully emerge.
</p>
<p>
But they could also be snake eggs, so I better keep an eye on ‘em.
</p>
<p>
We started the day working on the plot of land that my host father had set aside for my PC colleague and I to work on during our pre-service training (the three month stretch that I am now in). Together, Michelle and I would have hoed close to 400 square meters of dirt, to a depth of about 40 centimeters (with a malagasy Angady; a thin spade? On a long stick, and used for most earth-work; not to be confused with a la-pely, a conventional spade without a pointy edge, imposed by the french).
</p>
<p>
That is a lot of work! Not to mention that my first encounter with an angady resulted in some vicious blisters on parts of my anatomy that never knew a had day’s of work!
</p>
<p>
So picture my relief when my host father told me that instead of going with this fellow to his plot, he would come to us instead and do Michelle and I’s work (mostly) for us!
</p>
<p>
It turns out that for him (and only him) it is taboo (or fady) to work on his land on a Tuesday. So instead of shadowing him there, which would ruffle one of his ancestor’s feather’s, I shadowed him at home, well within range of little luxuries, filtered water, and oral re-hydration salts!
</p>
<p>
He arrived promptly at 7 AM, shoe-less (with all ten toes) in the mist, and without further ado we got to work. Since it was ostensibly my project I was in charge of explaining the concept of double digging (DD) to him in Malagasy. Not something I was very good at. I will explain DD below, and you can then picture me trying to get it across a language chasm: How does one mime the nitrogen cycle? Or increased water retention in the sub-soil?
</p>
<p>
Double digging involves preparing subsoil and topsoil in a bed so that nutrients (principally nitrogen and carbon, in the form of fresh leaves, and charcoal/dry leave/sticks) and moisture and air can be available to plant roots, so that these roots can grow very quickly though damp, loose soil, at any time of the year (wet/dry; cold/hot) and for 5-7 years without re-plowing.
</p>
<p>
To get to the subsoil you need to remove the top 20 cm of topsoil (and put it on the previously tilled trench of subsoil). The first scalp of topsoil is set aside to cover the last trench of subsoil plowed.
</p>
<p>
The subsoil is jiggled to a depth of 20 cm (mangadied; cultural note: nouns can become verbs by adding an “m” sound to their beginning; past is “n” sound, future is “h” giving us: I n-angadied and threw my back out yesterday, or, I plan on h-angadying again after my blisters heal).
</p>
<p>
Then the amendments are added.
</p>
<p>
These are, in no particular order (but in precise doses, measured in handfuls, fortunately for me since I covered anatomy in the previous day’s language class): cow poop (tain-omby; not used to express doubt in malagasy), charcoal, fresh leaves, dry leaves (both sound very much alike), sticks, ash, and compost.
</p>
<p>
Probably not all of these are the same time but I did not have by book handy and we were working far too fast for me to go back and peruse dirt-lit.
</p>
<p>
While I scrambled the ingredients, he nan-gadied the trenches, and in 5 hours we had prepared all the bed and went for lunch. It would have taken me close to a month on my own, and perhaps two with Michelle (chatting slows us down).
</p>
<p>
An hour or so later, full of beans (ie, lunch), we set off to till an auxiliary plot, which required clearing brush and chameleon eggs. I then spent most of the afternoon watering the morning’s bed and getting a doxycycline-doped farmer’s tan wile he continued hoeing stackhanovitely.
</p>
<p>
My host father payed him 5K Ar for his day’s work, dovetailing with the UN’s noted global poverty line.
</p>
<p>
We have since used the same techniques to amend the flower beds.
</p>
<p>
Currently in bloom are: camellias, azaleas, amaryllis, a host of wild and domestic orchids (none of which exist in the USA), lilies, peach trees (and other stone fruit), apples, pears and such, and a huge hedge of pink honey suckle that makes the entire garden smell divine.
</p>
<p>
I am working on how to provide pictures but connectivity is lacking for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Speak soon,
<p>
Love,

   <p><h3><u>Telma Works</h3></u></p>
    <a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
    <p>
    10/2/22
  <p> Dear friends,</p>
<p>
I am happy to let you know that its been 4 weeks and I am still going strong. I am about to go visit the site that will be my place of work for the next two years tomorrow; the amaryllis are in full bloom, and it is high watermelon season. Brick makers are wrapping up their pounding since rice soon will be ready to plant in the paddies they were mining for clay. The air is loaded with the dust that precedes the rains, the late spring.
</p>
<p>
I don’t really know where to put this in the letter but Telma hired a group of 75 to 100 local men to dig a ditch by hand and with medieval tools to bury a fiber optic cable, presumable to connect locals to the internet for the first time, and the whole 10 mile project was done in less than 2 weeks.
<p>
<p>
That was my first interaction with Telma, the telecomms company. Why must I interact with Telma? To work in Madagascar for the Peace Corps.
<p>
<p>
To work in Madagascar for the Peace Corps one must be reachable at all times with a local sim and a local number. We are told time and again that PC work is a 24/7 job, and so should be reachable on that schedule.
<p>
<p>
The biggest bang for taxpayer buck if you ask me (24*7*4*27 = 18,144 hours for 0 dollars per hour = ~$0 give or take, is pretty cheap for two years of rural development and grassroots diplomacy for the USA govt. and you reading this as well).
<p>
<p>
Generally, companies are happy to have customers beating their door requesting services. For some there are hurdles to hurdle before concluding a contract, but rarely is it more than filling out a few sheets and signing on the dotted line. I was therefore surprised when it transpired that, no, getting a phone number here would not end with a signature; in fact, the whole rigmarole would begin with one...
<p>
<p>
To prove that I am not fake, and to pursue me in case I commit a heinous crime, Telma is required to ask for some proof that I am who I say I am (or rather, a PC handler says I am, given there is no way for me to convey to a malagasy sim card salesman that I am not a fraud other than pointing at myself and saying Aho, “I”, which is exactly what a fraud would say and do).
<p>
<p>
If you are malagasy, the necessary document would be a blue laminated handwritten card that presumably carries enough bureaucratic oomph to make a sim card peddler stand to attention and alacritly sling sims.
<p>
<p>
If you are a peace corps volunteer, documentation is a highly suspect passport medley issued by the dubious USA govt. (personal and PC-issued passez) and any other potentates not yet forsworn. This raises a few eyebrows even among the ranks of the phlegmatic, from which Telma clerks and sales folk hail (I know a few).
<p>
<p>
Now, passeports in our day and age are fairly complex documents that don’t just grow on consulates. They have to be printed somewhere Knox-like and are probably assiduously counted by some sunken-eyed foreign service intern; what I am trying to say is that if your passport says that you are you, well, you must be, no?
<p>
<p>
And is two say so, even more so.
<p>
<p>
But if three do? That is some 9 sigma levels of likelihood of you being you. And although I was led to doubt it, I do still think that I am me.
<p>
<p>
Whew.
<p>
<p>
Well I have now discovered that the pretty shimmers of non-falsifiable paper-veneers, the holographic bald eagles clutching plants and arrows, the precise perforations, all that dross is secondary to the security conferred by the Signature.
<p>
<p>
Signatures are uniquely yours, non forge-able, and I think one’s own intellectual property by vtirtue of them being “you” in the written form. A signature is a proof irrefutable that whoever signed agrees that they are the signer; the one in charge, responsible, and worthy of the graces of whatever document bears the utterly irreproachable (handwritten) seal.
<p>
<p>
A Signature is, as you may begin to understand, primordial in identification. The ur-proof among lesser passport-proofs.
<p>
<p>
Which raises the important question: who decides if a signature is actually a signature?
<p>
<p>
Surely the one signing? The one who knows the secret flourishes and owns the muscles and their muscle memory that allow the sign to be scrawled?
<p>
<p>
Surely.
<p>
<p>
No.
<p>
<p>
It is in fact Telma.
<p>
<p>
Telma decides weather a signature is the one of the bearer, the contract have-er, the real McCoy. Telma and Telma Alone.
<p>
<p>
Not the consulate; hoodwinkable and overworked.
<p>
<p>
Not the “customer” who could be up to no good.
<p>
<p>
But the fellow ratifying the sales slip from the back of a yellow and green pickup truck.
<p>
<p>
The ultimate arbiter of truth has a fanny pack filled with a fistful of sim cards bound by a rubber band.
<p>
<p>
The heart of the matter is: my signatures do not match.
<p>
<p>
Or so says the clerk behind the safety bars at the Telma Shop (open 8-11; 2-4; Monday to Friday). I had to rely on the translation provided by my host father who had happened to be walking by and heard a commotion and so could not help but stick his head in and provide a much needed backbone to stand up to the Crooks (embodied by the clerk, who had no clue which idiot took care of the paper-work, and we should go bother them, not her, and she was busy making change for a constant stream of curious townspeople, could you not see).
<p>
<p>
As it stands: my signature on my passport (personal) does not match the signature on my passport (Peace Corps*) does not match my signature on a thin sales receipt (hancocked while squatting). How much do they differ? Hard to tell. One of the several malagasy fellers who helped translate on that second pacification attempt post host-father intervention told me that some of the parts that “should” be pointy were curvy, and some of the parts that “should” have been curvy were pointy. Ah. 
<p>
<p>
Says I: does the clerk have some tracing paper so that I can respect that letter of the LAW? Reply: No, and any tracing attempts would be rejected since the less-than-fluid lines would be outed as forgeries posthaste (under his breath: you stupid-signature idiot). So instead I turned on my phone flashlight, put it under the signature section of the passport, overlaid the sales paper, and forged away; indeed: shaky lines, but pointy where needed.
<p>
<p>
(Suject bac philo: is it metaphysically possible to forge something that you own or only you can create? Vous avez quatre heures.)
<p>
<p>
*footnote: PC Mada HQ still had that one under lock and key, and proactively emailed me a picture of that signature for reference, which was not particularly helpful because at that time that signature had not yet been put onto a sales slip and so was completely irrelevant.
<p>
<p>
Although the Peace Corps staff only said “can you try harder to sign your signature better next time” I could really tell that they were thinking “why does your signature suck so much”. Because yeah, after all, this palaver is completely my fault.
<p>
<p>
Well, says I, if it is a question of having the signature on the passport and sales slip match, why don’t we start over again, with a new sales slip and with a new passport from a totally different country? My host father said no, we won’t let these crooks walk all over you, we won’t pay a single red Ariary more, we will take this to the top (Tana) and get the big boss himself to look at the documents and force him to acknowledge how bad their customer service is.
<p>
<p>
The Peace Corps folks say yes, that is a good idea.
<p>
<p>
I spend a few days practicing french signing, walk over again, produce a mint French pass, forge my signature on the slip expertly, pay the 13K to get a new sim, and, miracle of miracles, send a text message to the PC duty phone. Received. I can now do my job.
<p>
<p>
It actually wasn’t that hard to open a cell line in-fine, all you need is dual nationality of USA/EU. How most malagasy manage with neither remains mysterious.
<p>
<p>
But wait...
<p>
<p>
…
<p>
<p>
SIKE!
<p>
<p>
Turns out, Telma sleuths though it odd that “Yarmoff, Eric” appeared twice in their sales-spreadsheet, pulled a few levers and saw, horror of horrors, that there were now THREE passports, two sales slips (with several attempts at a signature on each), two headshots (one smiling, one with glasses on) and not a single matching element in the whole darned mess.
<p>
<p>
Cell line canceled.
<p>
<p>
I now can’t do my job.
<p>
<p>
Flash of inspiration on the part of PC staff: just change telecoms companies.
<p>
<p>
So down in a shanty near the market, over the course of 30 heart-in-mouth minutes, a new mother working for Airtel (child in rear of shack whimpering) sets up a cell line for yours truly (YT); and Alex, who Telma swears is a leettle boy when in fact she is an adult woman (her passport photo: long blonde hair; her Telma mugshot: buzz-short PC haircut; you are actually not you, says we).
<p>
<p>
Success?
<p>
<p>
The next day the line is still un-canceled so: success.
<p>
<p>
After 3 weeks, I now can do my job again, this time with 4G. 5G ready for when that happens.
<p>
<p>
No matter what they say I still like my signature.
<p>
<p>
But from now on, all passpts will be marked with an X and nothing else.
<p>
<p>
And you know what the worst part is: when I called the Telma customer service line they said (in perfect french) that the problem was not with the signatures, never had been: it’s that the picture the telma rep took of one of my passports is blurry, that’s all. Just get that fixed and have a nice life!
<p>
<p>
The sun is out, the lake is beautiful, I am going to take a long, hot, solar shower.
<p>
<p>
Lots of love,
<p>
<p>

   <p><h3><u>The Road (1)</u></h3></p>
   <a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
    <p>
   10/18/22 
<p>
<p>
I went on a visit to my final resting place in Mada, and it took me some time to get over it, hence the delay between last email. Sorry.
<p>
<p>
I was not sure if I should talk about Malagasy roads so early in my stay but recent developments have made me think about them quite a bit more than before: and so some of my first impressions.
<p>
<p>
The exchange of goods, people, and ideas is essential to a functioning society and roads are one major venue for such exchanges. What comes below can be read through that lens.
<p>
<p>
There are not many roads in Madagascar, and most of them are unpaved. Most aren't passable during the rains. A few around Montasoa have cobble stretches made of granite blocks, or covered in smaller golfball-sized pebbles left over from the cobble cutting process.
<p>
<p>
(The one-man artisanal “mines” I saw were on the side of the big road, for if one is not close enough to a truck-capable route mining is not economically viable. These were a very small plot of cleared land that exposed the bedrock, from which a 2 meter tall face had been chiseled out to produce cobbles. I saw one man sitting on a car sized boulder, hammer in one hand, chisel in the other, painstakingly creating a dotted line that would allow him to split the boulder in two, and from thence repeat the process till the rock was reduced to paving stones, or him to insanity. It seemed only slightly faster than the change a trickle of water dripping onto the surface would bring. All over the highway one can see variously pocked rocks, each being split, slowly. One also sees piles of cobbles that embody lord only knows how many hours of draining, ringing, jarring labor.)
<p>
<p>
These roads soon return to a more natural state, if one travels a short distance: to dirt (and in a month or so: mud); if one travels a certain amount of time: potholed, and with portions of the hard man-made elements shifting elsewhere.
<p>
<p>
I like these roads: they are ideal for mountain biking, they limit the speed of traffic to a leisurely 5 mph and there is no risk of being hit by a car. They are quiet, pedestrians and cows intuitively walk down the middle, and they are a common space to meet others. Ox drawn carts are the preferred freight transport. When following my host father to the market we always stop to chat with others out on similar errands. These roads are convivial in town, and calm outside of it.
<p>
<p>
On one of these roads I got as close as I ever will to skiing in Madagascar: in the deep and pink dust of a downhill stretch I skidded/slalomed my bike from side to side on the smooth parts and jumped off the moguls. The government requires us to wear helmets.
<p>
<p>
These roads are terrible for building prosperity. They are huge barriers to emergency services (if/when these exist). I saw a house burning and despite 200 some people trying to extinguish it with buckets of water, they achieved virtually nothing. It is far quicker for a woman in labor to walk to the midwife than to wait for a car to come to her, and then, for the car to jostle her thence. And although there are no firetrucks and very few ambulances anyways, one can speculate that there may be more if they actually could be used.
<p>
<p>
With this being said, it should not be a surprise that the few roads that are thoroughly paved are The places to be. They carry considerable freight, passengers in Taxi Brousses, and hope for prosperity.
<p>
Proximity to road = pricing transparency, more choice, more ability to sell produce into larger market.
<p>
Prox. to road = ability to go to hospitalization, education, political centers, exercise rights even.
<p>
Prox. to road = prox. of choice.
<p>
<p>
My PC destination choice: Madagascar; bashfully, I admit, for the lack of cars and the bucolic quiet of the country Lanes described above. During my site visit: reality. The house is very close to the road. I was placed in a town with the wherewithal to know about and ask for a PC volunteer: I am with someone benefiting form the road.
<p>
And I think I will suffer :(
<p>
In short: the trucks are loud, I can’t sleep, the headlights light up my room in a very depressing way, the house trembles, the air smells like burning oil, I smell it in my bed. Despite so many people on it, that road made me feel more alone than ever before. Silver lining: I spent very little time indoors and met many community members.
<p>
<p>
The road is full of trucks, old and new. The old ones are from the 60’s, likely some of the same described in Dervla Murphy’s travelogue (Muddling Through Madagascar) written in the 80s. They spew such huge clouds of black smoke and burning oil one might assume they are coal powered locomotives. Newer ones still produce noxious fumes and noxious honking: is is customary for vehicles to salute one another aurally and to warn that they are passing, or that it is safe for someone to pass them (this generally occurs going around blind corners where the truck being passed has more line of sight than the vehicle doing the passing). Taxi Brousses that ply the Road honk to the oncoming friends they recognize. Often twice. They honk at pedestrians and cyclists to warn them that they are about the be passed. They honk going around corners, and sometimes they honk as a joke, for fun, to test the pneumatics, by accident.
<p>
<p>
Taxi brousses can take you anywhere. I merely need to step off my veranda when one approaches (honking to alert potential passengers in the region of its presence) and I can be whisked in moderate comfort to the capital. At a cost of 10K Ar, the same as a single trip on the Boston T. I can have my bike lashed on top for last mile mobility, or also a crate of chickens, a ton of charcoal, or a cat sewed into a bag (the superlative method of transporting cats and origination of the expression: once a cat is out of a bag it will never in its nine live return). The trucks carry shipping containers from Tamatave, the largest port of Madagascar. They also carry woven baskets of produce and other sentimental cargo that relatives of the driver hope to send far away at low cost, these are wedged into spaces kept clear in Europe due to excessive regulation.
<p>
<p>
Car hygiene is staggering: people wash their cars at any opportunity, hotels propose engine bay detailing. The PC scrubs its fleet of white Land Cruisers daily.
<p>
<p>
The road is deteriorating. It used to Take 2:30 hours to go to Tamatave when Pierre (my HF) still worked. Now it takes close to 6. The drivers try and make up for the times they need to crawl over debris by driving as fast as their vehicle allows when the road is good. If another vehicle limits speed, it is to be passed with preternatural honkommunication. If one side of the road is good it is used regardless of traffic “laws”, common courtesy and sense prevail: if someone else is already engaged on the stretch of road you covet, it is proper to let them exit before you enter; t-honk you very much. Malagasy drivers use all of the road. Especially when there isn’t much left.
<p>
<p>
Libertarians take note: when the govt. does not actively participate in infrastructure maintenance individuals step in and the market rewards them: in places of notorious potholes entrepreneurs dig small holes in the side of the mountain to access clay that they use to smooth over gaps in pavement. Drivers hand them a few hundred Ariary if they think the work deserves it. Plenty of stretches of the road are choked with the resultant dust. This gives rise to further employment: young girls and their mothers pour water on the road to tame the dust. I haven't seen any one give them any money. Sometimes a pothole will last a few dozen meters. Few artisianal maintenance crews can tackle these alas. Road entropy IRL.
<p>
<p>
One can say: Olona tsy Akoho (people are not chickens) and your driver will stop by the side of the road for a bathroom break. Often a passenger will ask to stop to pick up some produce or to buy a snack. The drive obliges and the rest of the passengers hope that the delay won’t be long. One woman took 20 minutes to buy two bags of chips.
<p>
<p>
I have yet to see anyone vomit.
<p>
<p>
We aren’t allowed to travel during the night, or drive our own vehicle, or ride on a motorcycle. After seeing a bit of the roads and their uses here I have no intention to.
<p>
<p>
Today we went on a field trip and spent the entire day being chauffeured around in convoy of white Toyota land-cruisers, on the Road, and on side tracks. I’ll try and write more about that in the future because it was an active enough to warrant a whole email.
<p>
<p>
Velooma!

   <p><h3><u>Wetness! Growth! Green! Halloween!</u></h3></p>
  <a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
 10/31/22
  <p>  Sorry for the long delay! Or is it long?
<p>
Time has been moving in strange patterns here, sometimes it drags so slow that one can barely conceive the amount of time remaining (600 plus days!) and at other times it passes through in huge boluses of action that pack more life into a few days than I would choose if it were up to me. But little is up to me yet.
<p>
So to me it feels like quite some time since I have sent an update, especially after complaining about roads and transit. Here I hope to talk about more pleasant stuff, like gardens and Halloween celebration and teaching people in a new language.
<p>
It is October 31st today! One of my favorite days in the year stateside: the crisp air! The Indian Summer! The children and teens and parents and 20somethings, and 30somethings and everyone else dressing up as fun or spooky iterations of their id. A group of my US pals dressed up as the blue, green, red, and orange (on fire) Boston T lines. Spooky indeed!
<p>
Here the materials for costume making are fewer and require a bit more inventiveness: I will be dressing up as the Dog from Scooby Doo and originally was trying to find a puck of brown boot polish but was convinced that it might be best not to slather myself with that (not only would it be wasteful, but it covering yourself in boot polish is only acceptable if you are the son of a Canadian prime minister!) The other four members of the mystery gang will be the other four members of the Agriculture volunteers (there are only 5 of us in Madagascar). Hopefully I will be able to provide a picture at some point (and it won’t be damaging for my future political career, don’t worry).
<p>
<p>
We Ag(riculture) volunteers have been working together on various garden plots and they have been starting to really grow by now. As another reminder of the passing of time, the speed at which various bean plants prosper gives a good indication of how much time I have spent in country: my beans are growing with verdant zip, testament to the work I put into preparing and fertilizing the soil, and the fact that I can water them with a hose (luxury) moving well water from an electric pump fed cistern (big luxury). The beans in some of the lower rice fields have sprouted but are struggling to match the vitality of mine and although not neglected, do seem to be left in thrall to the whims of passing chickens and their chicks.
<p>
<p>
Also, the chicks grow. I have seen them go from being adorable black and yellow balls of pure cheeping fluff huddling in the shadow of the mother hen to partially fledged little balls (starting at the tips of their wings). Then they start growing in size and begin to resemble the mother in miniature, with variations of the parent colors. Some have large pink, raw patches (bottom of the pecking order), others simply disappear, but with time they all are growing inevitably larger, just like the beans. Some chickens seem to bask in a motherly glow, with all feathers glossy and in perfect order. Others are muddy and scrawny. Some are Malagasy breeds and their legs are long and sleek. Some are imported egg or meat hens and their feathers make it look like they are wearing shorts.
<p>
Despite being completely free to range wherever they please, birds seem to stay within a few hundred feet of their birth places (for their entire life!) which allows people to keep track of what they theoretically own (and determine when that end is!)
<p>
<p>
One of the things that does not seem to be growing as fast as the garden or its inhabitants is my capacity for Malagasy. I can string together a few choice words for predictable situations, tell someone that my stomach hurts (but not my head or throat), and generally compliment someone on their baby (though I am stuck with round since I don’t know “plump”). I learned how to say protean today. This past week I had to push the limits of my skill and give a 45 minute presentation to a Malagasy farmer about integrated pest management (better known as IPM). Pest translates to Bibi-kely (small animal), Integrated and Management are, fortunately for me, franco-linguistic imports; though the effect those words have on the rural Malagasy imaginations is, I fear, limited.
<p>
From there I had to give a background on the theory of “cultural” pest management practices (such as two and three field crop rotation), proper plant health and diagnosis of thrips or nematodes (bibikely), worms and aphids (bibikely), rust (bibikely?), or other ailments all of which have the tendency to manifest when at a treatable stage with delicate subtleties in color and temperament, descriptions of which my brutally minimalist Malagasy fails to capture.
<p>
<p>
To palliate such obvious deficiencies in communication I relied on wordless charts of the hierarchy of pest management practices, as well as a fully written out script that my language professor had the kindness (and mercy) to generously and liberally edit. Most of that document was greek to me, and I ended up reciting the treatise without much knowledge of its contents (it also does not help that the majority of it was in the spoken passive tense, when I am only now capable of hearing active verbs). The big problem became apparent when I was asked a question about the contents of my oration: it could have been something as simple as “did you say bibikely or bibikely?” or something as existentially challenging as “why dose nothing I plant grow?” to which I could only hope my “heny! (yes!)” would be a grammatically (never mind logically) correct answer. Most of the time the interrogator did not ask for any follow up clarifications.
<p>
<p>
Perhaps that is because I butchered most of the pronunciations anyways…
<p>
<p>
Below a sampling of agricultural bon mots:
<p>
- mahafantacha ny fomba famonoana bibikely amin’ny ady gasy ianao sy mahalala ny fotoana tokony hampiasana azy.
<p>
- Fomba manaraka afaka mapiasa fomba ara Fizika: hoach, esorina ny ravina Ratsy amin’ny voly na vonoana amin’ny Tanana ny bibikely.
<p>
-Folo litra amin’ny fanafody dia ampy amendrahana zato metacha carres (note the malagasy/french).
<p>
<p>
Whip one out at your next cocktail party!
<p>
<p>
Next week I will give a presentation on nutrition to a lactating mother about how she should feed her child, and the nuances between kwashikor, scurvy, and beri-beri.
<p>
<p>
Unfortunately there is a lot less practical activity (compared to preparing compost layers, hard to do when there is no MG word for layer) and I will have to pad out the 45 minutes with plenty of tangents into such esoterica as FAO and UNICEF’s seven key practices for rural wellbeing.
<p>
<p>
Fun linguistic kerflufle: Tany (soil/dirt) is a homonym of Tany (the past tense of Any: over there).
<p>
<p>
The rainy season is almost here: there have been a couple of downpours and a few days with lightning forking through the smoky sky. The air has cleared, rain put out the slash and burn fires, doused the brick kilns, and turned dust to mud; I can see the hills and breath freely.
<p>
<p>
Some folks hoping for rain enlist the occult forces of fellows claiming to have a say in “the weather”. Unfortunately for them there are also people with a desire for dryness (for their kiln-work or travel) who hire similarly endowed sorcerers to opposite ends. A celestial battle ensues and, given the fairly equal level of the forces involved, a stalemate follows where the final say comes down to factors out of any earthly participant’s hands: the bested magician will admit defeat and claim that if only more money had been handed over more potent mysticism could have been wrought. The cynic talks about the water-cycle (in Malagasy). The wet brick-maker takes it philosophically: the rain was bound to come eventually.
<p>
Ah wetness :)
<p>
<p>
Mango season is upon us and litchi season is around the corner! Watermelons are out, new green leaves are in. 
<p>
<p>
Lots of love,

  <p>
  12/1/22
  <p> Sorry for the long delay!
<p>
<p>
<p>
Some of you have reached out to ask if you were still on the mailing list since you had not received word in the past few weeks!
<p>
Hark!
<p>
The letters return.
<p>
Since I last set finger to keyboard a lot has happened and I will sum up in the broadest strokes below.
<p>
<p>
<p>
I finished the pre-service training, barely, and managed to scrape by into service despite hiccups with my language learning (I was not allowed to breathe a word of french in the vicinity of the training center and my failure to do so, after having denied my french self for close to 3 months, led to a frank exchange of ideas with PC Madagascar hierarchy. The ensuing exposure to pure power politics that I faced sobered me enough to suck up and swear in; the ceremony was presided over by her excellency the ambassador and met all my needs for pomp and diplomatic gravitas that had been so lacking during training).
<p>
Following that came several days, if not weeks, of pure whirlwind preparation for settling into my permanent site! My colleague down the road and I worked together to gather all necessary supplies in the capital first, then in the sizable market town (Moramanga) that we will be using henceforth for our most major purchases (such as sandpaper or oyster sauce, two rare and valuable items). The time in Tana was exceedingly hectic because of not only the sheer amount of places that we visited but mostly because of the traffic that separated them. The PC provided the services of a driver and a car to each group of geographically similar volunteers, which allowed us to go back and forth between the large (Jumbo) supermarket that serves mainly Europeans and well heeled Malagasy (where you can find scented candles, blenders, fresh fish and toothsome cheese as well as an enormous wine display by all but french standards) and the teeming second hand book market (that had almost no malagasy books), and a plethora of solar panel and electronic shops that Michelle hoped could help her buy a system to charge her laptop but where they could not provide, either due to lack of parts, knowledge, ability to process payment, or just plain old inertia.
<p>
Then we drove east on the Road, in the white Land Cruiser laden with bike, gas canisters, and green steamer trunks lashed on top, to Moramanga. There a night in the hotel turned into three because the house that I was to live in for the next two years was still being renovated! The work crew (neighborhood men who owned hammers and were curious of the proceedings, and so happy to lend a hand) had been busy retrofitting a two room, whitewashed, tin roofed, brick building that may have housed someone else up until recently. That I got the space could very well result from an eviction, but I don’t know and for the time being I am choosing to not delve too much further, and can’t really, given my Malagasy skills.
<p>
The space was divided by a tarp (which I asked to be removed so that I could have more sunlight throughout), and has two doors facing north-east, and two windows facing east (or thereabouts, note that in the southern hemisphere, North is the sunny direction). The blind walls abut my “land lady’s” shop and house. The community is in charge of bearing the housing costs of hosting me (per PC rules) however I contribute to the power and water bills (given that I do have power, enough for lights and charging devices, but not enough for an electric kettle: when I turned my newly purchased one on, the wires buzzed, and then within 20 seconds the power went out. I asked my neighbors if there was a local blackout, they checked the meter and said “strange, there was a huge spike in power and then the fuses blew…” So no kettle for me, and since I have a single pot I have to be strategic when I cook my beans/heat water for tea; I have had to go several morning without hot beverage since the pot was full of leftover/breakfast beans).
<p>
Built for me at the same time was a combined washroom/outhouse. Brick made, it feels safe to go in there and squat over a bucket of lukewarm water and wipe the grime off. With every “shower” cleaning myself gets easier: the first shower involved me forgetting a cup and so pouring freezing water over my head straight form the bucket in the dark; I am in to process if rigging up a jerry-can on the roof of the structure to heat the water and dribble it out of a little hose so that I don’t need to repeat those grim ablutions.
<p>
Both are locked so that kids and ne’erdowells don’t use my precious stock of toilet paper, or leave the seat up without flushing. (Just kidding it is a hole with no seat or flush).
<p>
One of the reasons the house was unfit when I first arrived was that there was no ceiling between me and the roof which would have led to unbearable heat in the sunnier months. Putting this up was a long and perilous process that involved many men laboriously fitting tongue and groove planks (and running out several times prompting building lulls and so more hotel nights) on rickety ladders over the cement floor in what would have been prime examples for an OSHA safety training video of how not to install a ceiling. No one was hurt. And all these men still had 10 fingers.
<p>
A perfect time to loose a finger would be during the cutting of the wood. The is either done by hand using one of my two chairs as a work bench, wood braced with a bare foot, and with vigorous, very jerky use of a handsaw constantly jumping out of the cut; or with a power tool that looked like it was an axle grinder but now fitted with a circular saw blade. That thing was scary, holy cow. I made sure to stay well out of the way, and out of the plane inertia would carry the blade fragments should this one break (no eye protection of course). The blade was very dull and it seemed like the wood was being cut as much as by the blade’s teeth as by the friction of the disc: within a few seconds every cut would be billowing blue smoke and many of the pieces of wood I currently see have a cauterized edge.
<p>
All said and done, my ceiling is beautiful (though incomplete, they ran out of wood with about 20 square feet left and so blocked the hole to the attic with a tarp reading “elegance”), about 12 feet high and with exposed beams. It is very easy to nail or screw things into it (such as my mosquito net, electrical wiring for my two bulbs, or down the line: produce from my garden like herbs, onions and garlic). The metal roof tells me when it is raining, sometimes deafeningly. Small birds and chickens like to walk on it with a nail-on-chalkboard sound in the early hours of the morning: time to wake up! To keep down the roof in times of high wind there are bags of sand draped over it, these are old and leaky make it feel like I am living in a very profitable gravel mine or an ongoing landslide. The birds like to play in these too.
<p>
Currently everything I own is on the floor so there are carpentry projects in my future, such as building shelves, a kitchen table, stools and perhaps even a chair. There are so many projects that it can be paralyzing to even think about the future more than a few hours/days ahead.
<p>
One project I have successfully started is my personal garden. I have a fence enclosing a small front yard, this space used to be part of a footpath/plaza well trod for years. The soil, from which they make bricks, was as hard as that building material. Over the course of a few days of loosening and watering I was able to dig the brick down to about 20 some cm and now will start amending the clay with sand, charcoal, and other delicious plant parts in the aim of making it fertile for the next few years.
<p>
The gardens I will work on with counterparts here are not yet underway but at east I know where they are and I have more time for that I think.
<p>
So far I have met plenty of people with fond memories of the previous volunteers which makes the town far more homey. I can feel the trace that these Americans left behind, and though remote now in space (the closest American is 3 to 4 hours away), there feels like a proximity in time: like the smell of perfume in the elevator after a certain woman just left. This is manifest in the excitement extended by the Malagasy to my arrival as well as in the things the Americans built: a library filled with donated books circa 2014 (so lots of second hand novels that are all infused with Obama’s first term, the war on terror, the Financial Crisis, and Katrina) a thriving worm farm providing fertilizer for coffee seedlings, and even a small school house.
<p>
Hopefully this is enough to keep you tided as to my well-being, so much was going on that I just could not manage to record and broadcast my experience. That is changing now as I attempt to create a new routine to settle into.
<p>
As always, I welcome your replies!
<p>

    Merry Christmas, Seventh night, and happy holidays.
<p>
<p>
I am writing two emails in quick succession, this on comes from before the holiday, the following will treat my Christmas experience here. Its a double header!
<p>
<p>
Although there are pine trees here, no-one I know uses them as Christmas trees; so instead, for my own sake, I have dubbed the massive litchi tree nearby as my Christmas tree. It is huge and green and has bunches of golf ball-sized red berries blanketing it that can almost be mistaken for baubles. If you don’t know what a litchi nut looks like I recommend you look it up: they ripen from lime green to bright red, have skin like a dinosaur, and taste incredibly tropical, whatever that means to you. And they have a shiny brown pit that is perfect for spitting out of you mouth and kicking away before it hits the ground.
<p>
<p>
In the spirit of the season, which I will say is incredibly fervent here, I purchased a Jesus bearing poster in the market as a Christmas present for myself. (I am offering a faucet to my land-water lord but other than that: no presents, most folks I've asked have said that's only for rich people...)(and the faucet is self interested as I will use it too; like offering cans of tuna to your best friend, or navy dress socks to your cat).
<p>
<p>
The poster is a bit over the top. If it weren’t for the fervor of the population it was destined for, I would even consider it quasi blasphemous given how close it reads to parody. Along the top, scream red capitals on a yellow background: “NO JESUS NO LIFE”. Below, a mosaic of the important events in His life, though on quarter of the space is taken up by a remarkably Asian appearing Christ with a burning heart and quote from Romans about unconditional love.
<p>
<p>
In a sense, the poster is like stained glass cathedral windows of yesteryear: they tell of the inception of christian salvation though evocative visuals: from the birth of the haloed infant, the entry into Jerusalem, the apparition post tomb to the women of his life (God's gift, eh?), and of course the crucifixion (here the gruesome carpentry and removal from the cross only). There is a cartoonish rendition of the renaissance masterpiece stolen by Napoleon: The Last Supper helpfully subtitled with “ANDREW JAMES PHILLIP JUDAS PETER JOHN JESUS CHRIST BARTHOLOMEW THOMAS MATTHEW JAMESH THADDEUS SIMON”. Prior to its removal to the Louvre the original stood in a mess hall for religious types which must have been fun. I'll face mine during my recurring suppers.
<p>
I originally gravitated towards the poster because of all the other renaissance paintings on it, but now notice that one of the scenes is very reminiscent of my great aunt’s later works and wonder if there might be a copyright infringement here somewhere. 
<p>
But the real reason that I bought the poster is to decorate my house/room.
<p>
<p>
I have finally reached a point where I feel the energy in me to work on not merely survival tasks like cooking and bathing (though I still gasp under the why-can't-it-get-hotter-despite-standing-in-the-sun-all-day water).
<p>
The corner was rounded with my completion of a set of shelves I had been sweating over for the past three or four weeks.
<p>
<p>
It started with the tree trunk itself, an old pine that had been roughly squared away and turned into planks as I watched (did I tell you about this already? I can’t quite remember…), but the main point here was that the sawmill was so full of sawdust piles snowing all the machinery under that I could hardly believe the place was not on fire once or twice a week. I’ve since bought planks from the mountain folk who come down to market on Saturdays with their own wood that is often a lot thicker and comes with the services of a salesperson willing to lug it all to my house.
<p>
<p>
I have (had) no woodworking experience at all prior to this, so every single step was a learning process, but thanks to a friend (Greg Palis, wood worker extraordinaire) sending me memes about planing wood I have progressed immensely.
<p>
I learned how to rasp, plane, sand properly and what grit to use, and so on. Shelves are not complicated, its just planks at right angles, nothing serious. And yet…
<p>
<p>
Each step took hours given that I have to do everything by hand. I started out sanding the rough wood (should have started planing, but this is how I learn), first with 60 grit (rough sand) then 120 grit (fine sand) paper. Each side took, oh I don't know, an hour? it felt that long.. I have blisters behind my pinky, like on the back of my hand. I don't know howww.... But the pain was worth it: The wood was soft to the touch like I have never before experienced. Perhaps that has something to do with the copious sweat that I dripped onto/into each plank as I worked.
<p>
<p>
Then I measured distances with a string to make sure that I would put the holes in places that would keep shelves horizontal (which I managed in the end, spirit level flat!) and would allow room between shelves for my water filter, manuals, books, and pineapples.
<p>
<p>
Then using a human (me) powered drill I punched out the holes bespoke for each tab on each shelf, and spent eons filing away at the wood to make the fit just right. One of those files they bake into cakes for prisoners' usage. I had to file because someone took my chisel when they finished working on the house…
<p>
(where did I get all these tools you ask? I took them from my grandfather's barn; some of the tools ante-date him even, and came from Farmer Brown who lived in that house and used to hitch his wife up to plow to get his land ready for corn or something. The plow remains in Marblehead and looks remarkably alike those found here).
<p>
<p>
Then I plugged the tabs into the sockets with copious squeaking I did not know wood was capable of.  And the final result is light! And solid! Bespoke! With no nails (because they took those along with the chisel)!
<p>
The best part is that now my belongings are not on the ground. The psychological difference between having all your books and china in plies and neatly stacked in cubbyholes made for each individual object is striking; it is humanizing. Having furniture and especially the order that enables made me a much happier man. Furniture is an essential part of human dignity. 
<p>
And with that dignity, I can now turn my thought to the higher tier Hanslow (or whoever) needs: soulful decoration and more work with those I am here to serve.
<p>
<p>
For the time being my work is constrained by my language but my demonstration plot is prepared and I have sown preliminary corn. I can’t wait to keep you updated as to how that grows and what beautiful plants I sow.
<p>
Warning: Beggary below!
<p>
If you are hoping that my work here could help even quicker, or that your holiday cheer compels you to encourage me to that end, I recommend you to donate to an NGO or charity that operates in Madagascar. One that I have been in contact with and will work with in the future is called the Zebu Overseas Board (ZOB) which runs a microloan program for farmers to purchase cows (Zebu): called PEZ. I’ll let you look it up if you are interested.
<p>
Cows here are huge boosts to smallholder agricultural productivity and I can see firsthand how necessary they are to food safety given that they provide farm labor (like a tractor), fertilizer, and at the end, food. The first two are unaffordable in their petroleum using/based forms here, and the last is always scarce, especially the nutritious kind. They are also a store of value for the un-banked, helping stave off penury in times of need. Once a farmer is on the virtuous cycle of cow based wealth creation, the ZOB finds that delinquencies on PEZ are quite rare. They have figures on their website (though I forget if it is also in English. Let me know and I can translate anything you send me from french).
<p>
The ZOB provides farmers with a loan (using your funds) which is repaid with 6% interest over 2 years. The initial capital and accrued interest are then available to the donor (you) to come collect in Madagascar (and I can guarantee that if you come here to do that I will gladly be your tour guide).
<p>
They asked me to reach out to my network about donations so please don’t think that all my letters from now on will have a commercial bent. They will not. But just this once.
<p>
<p>
There are a bunch of kids (there are always a bunch of kids) throwing rocks at my litchi tree to try and dislodge the sweet nuts, they then run to pick up the fallen ones and the biggest one always gets there first. They just kicked a pit in through my window and it made a very loud bong on my mirror. But no bad luck for them thankfully.
<p>
<p>
Also of note, in one of the biblical downpours that occurs everyday at 4 pm (it is the RAIN season) my outhouse’s foundations shifted and now there is a large crack in the structure. The silver lining is that my shower now drains better. I just hope that it does not all slide down the hill.
<p>

   12/28/22
<p>
Dear Friends,
<p>
On the 25th I was lucky enough to be part of the deeply christian, yet undeniably Malagasy celebration of Christmas. Below is a brief recollection of the events.
<p>


It is hot in Madagascar during Christmas time. It always has been, and consequently, the feeling of end of year celebrations are completely alien to me, just like the bitter cold and prevailing darkness (and subsequent holiday lights) would be to the Malagasy.
<p>
The virgin birth and the peregrinations of the wise-men and shepherds* are always celebrated in sweltering conditions, with the intense rains coming down at 4PM sharp every afternoon (thereby putting a natural end to any social obligations). As much as the climate differs, the practicalities of the holiday are reassuringly similar to any person who has celebrated a “western” Christmas before. For one, the songs are all the same.
<p>
*(Malagasy equivalent: cow keepers, a job given to young boys or old men who must have some familial stake in the well being of the animal, but are happy to cow, as it were, the animal when it starts eating stranger’s crops; there are virtually no sheep here).
<p>

Starting in late November I heard my first. To be honest, I was wondering if it would be the only Christmas song I would hear all year, and that I would have to content myself with “jingle bells” whistled from the back of an ox-pulled cart (there is no more apposite a place to whistle that one than in a one horse open sleigh!) But no, my fears of song drought were quickly dispelled; music is integral to Malagasy life. Since that day, the prevalence of Christmas songs has steadily increased until on the 24-25 it would occupy 95% of all songs that I could hear!
<p>
I have been treated to a duet (or duel) of Christmas carols for the past few weekends (and weekday mornings) blaring from chest sized speakers equidistant from my house. (An additional set belongs to my landlord’s son who likes to sing karaoke throughout the day, though only a few of his chosen songs are christmassy).
<p>
At first I was all like, well of course one would play “silent night”, or “god rest ye merry gentlemen” it is Christmas time after all. But only when people started playing electro-pop remixes of what had been to me stale but reliable tunes for a very particular moment and place (often crackling wood-fire adjacent) that I realized just how odd the whole situation is. "Why on earth would the generally reverent Malagasy people dare desecrate a hymn?", morphed into “why not?”. After all, these songs are virtually interchangeable with “all I want for Christmas is YOU”, a perfectly secular song submitted to relentless re-inventions, when you have no understanding of the lyrics or cultural imperative to treat some songs with respect and others not. They feed the seasonal feeling, that’s all. And the seasonal though tends to be: “lots of music, as soon as the sun rises, and as loud as possible”.
<p>
French songs from my high-school Christmas-pageant days made the cut; “il est né le divin enfant” is quite popular here.
<p>

On the day of, I wanted to go to church. Church is one of the bigger events in any Malagasy person’s week and so one of the more lively places to be on a Sunday, a Sunday that happened to be the 25th to boot! A few weeks before I had hinted to my mayor that I would be interested in seeing what was on offer, and having quizzed me in the past as to my religious antecedents (and accepting my coy explanation of having attended a nominally Catholic school), he invited me to join him at his Catholic congregation. A week before: no real confirmation for our tryst. Finally, the night of the 24th, he stops by and says be ready for pick-up at 7:30 AM as the service starts at 8.
<p>
Duly scrubbed and shirted we arrived at the Catholics' place at quarter to. The church is big and built into the hillside; such design gave ample space on the hill/wall for all sorts of crosses, be-jesused and not, tinsel, flashing lights, and the two only Christmas conifers I have seen here (see previous email). Of note is a large golden orthodox icon of the holy infant and mother, and a replica of an 18th or 19th century painting of a European priest reaching enlightenment, taking off newly haloed haloed from the steps of his church under the shocked gaze of scrawny beggar children, a one legged man, and a mad flautist. I think the (subsequently) saintly person is named Bernard. It is the largest structure in my town by a long shot.
<p>
There were multitudes milling outside the structure long before the start of the service. It turns out that they were the overflow bunch that had arrived too late to get into the massive interior where the mayor’s wife had saved us seats! There must have been close to 3000 people, or who knows… More. 5000 for all I care. More people I have seen assembled in a very long time, and of all ages: from the wee suckling infant (10% of attendance) to the venerable folks who may have some vague recollection of the Merina monarchy preceding french colonial occupation. People continued to squeeze inside and eventually I had to share my postage-stamp-of-pew with two latecomers.
<p>
But what struck me more was how I had never quite seen such a slice of Malagasy life. Until now I had only glimpsed it in passing, on various Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings as I walked in the hills. It was the first time that every person that I was with was scrubbed, happy, and well dressed. Bored kids perhaps, but no-one suffering. While there are ecstatic Malagasy folk outside of church, my main interactions are with farmers (covered in clay, like myself) or with folks asking me for something (and their demeanor is careworn, their appearance raggedy); it is an inescapable part of everyday life. Except at church.
<p>
I got to see every single one of the 3000 (or 10 000) and concluded the above because everyone (everyone!) filed past me. My pew was situated close to the stable/manger nativity scene (trano-omby; lit. cow house) where everyone made a financial contribution. The process took over 30 minutes, despite the multitudes moving at a fast clip. The choir had to repeat some of the hymns they had started with! When I dropped in my 500 Ar note on top of the Wiemar-wheelbarrow of currency I barely had time to register who even made up the scene! (the blessed parents, but no wise men or even shepherds; their likenesses will be added in the biblically appropriate sequence in the next few days).
<p>
The service was primarily conducted through the singing of hymns (some of which I had been primed for over the previous month, however most were Malagasy), though there was more incense than I am used to (I had spotted a small group of men tending a charcoal fire outside that I had mistakenly assumed was to cater to the masses assembled long before even 7:30, but was destined for smokage instead). The Mexican priest who conducted the chanting provided my favorite part because I could understand most of what he said. There must be something about two foreigners having the same cadences that makes it easier for me to understand people who speak Malagasy as a second language; perhaps a book learning that forbids most contractions and a naïveté as to which syllables native speakers know to drop? He was wearing cowboy boots and blue jeans under his miter. That was embroidered with a world-map which included Madagascar on his back.
<p>
The service ended and at the doors deacons (or the catholic equivalent) handed out candy in lieu of gifts: Malagasy families don’t do much gift giving to each-other (I have been told that it is too costly). I then joined the Mayor’s family for lunch (potato salad, chicken curry with rice, and a superlative chocolate layered cake surrounded with ladyfingers tied with a pink bow and mango icing). His brother works for the GIZ (a German governmental outfit) so I could show off a bit of my German too, which is the most use that skill has been put to in years…
<p>
The rain came by and cleared everyone out slightly before 4PM, as it does every Christmas.

<p>
Happy holidays to all,
<p>
Much love,
<p>

   <p>
   
    To whom it may concern,
<p>

How are you dong? Has your job got you down? Sometimes it just feels like no matter what you do, you are either taken for granted or treated like a fool? Like the whole meeting you just had could have been an email, or that an email chain has gone off the rails somewhere upstream and now you are stuck in an oroboroic purgatory with no escape?
<p>
Well I am here to tell you that I am sorry you have had a tough day.
<p>
Go make yourself a cup a tea (I add a clove or two) and take the afternoon off, I am sure you deserve a little break.
<p>
I did that myself today, and it did a world of good; I only recently recovered from a little bout of covid and still tire easily, especially in the afternoons.
<p>
I have also dealt with some degree of bureaucratic absurdity that can only be truly savored in its entirety; my personal well-being requires sharing it. 
<p>
Now, my correspondent (J, in keeping with the nomenclature of the literature this exchange resembles) speaks/writes english as his third language (I’d like to see you try that!); which is besides the point. Even if we shared a mother tongue the result would have been the same.
<p>

And so, with no edits other than for clarity (and some shameful tyops):
<p>

[1/11, 4:16 PM] Ety: Hi J, Amanda told me you need me to submit the VRG [Peace Corps reporting software that is web-browser based, introduced for the first time this year] Q1 by the 15th. I could not do it yet because of connection issues and do not have the budget for another trip into Moramanga this week.
<p>

[1/11, 6:19 PM] J: Yes, we need data from PCVs [Peace Corps Volunteer] working in the field. If we do not have activity reports in VRG it would mean that PCVs in the field did not work during the quarter.
It is frustrating for not being able to travel to the banking town. If I understand well the situation you do not enough signal to open the VRG portal and cannot work on offline mode at site. You do not have enough money to go to your banking town to connect.
<p>

[1/12, 8:10 AM] Ety: I cannot upload VRG data from my site. An extra trip to Mouramanga is not in my budget. If I get reimbursed I can use the emergency cash. If not the data will be uploaded in Q2.
<p>

[1/12, 8:14 AM] J: Thank you Eric for the Clarification. Have done some activities at site during Q1?
<p>

[1/12, 8:17 AM] Ety: Yes: 5 one on one farmer trainings, full prep of demonstration plot (plus personal garden which serves as demo plot too) , two compost pile demonstrations, English club (6 students have attended in 3 sessions) , one on one English tutoring for an English professor, French tutoring for the veterinaire, and I am working on expanding the services at the CSB 1 [hospital] with the mayor.
<p>

[1/12, 8:29 AM] J: That is a good job Eric. Those activities should be reported in Q 1 to show our accomplishments during the first 3 - 4 months at site and the next activities that you will undertake will be reported in Q 2. How I would be helpfull to support you on reporting into VRG for Q 1?
<p>

[1/12, 8:33 AM] Ety: Well if you can approve a reimbursement for PC travel I can go to Moramanga and put this in.
<p>

[1/12, 8:49 AM] J: Let me aks the admin team and I get back to you later.
<p>

[1/12, 8:49 AM] Ety: Okay thank you
<p>

[1/12, 8:49 AM] J: Have you tried other options without going to Moramanga
<p>

[1/12, 8:50 AM] Ety: No but there is no WiFi here and with telma only what's app works (not emails even )
<p>

[1/12, 8:52 AM] J: Have talked to people about wifi coffee in Anjiro or spot where the coverage is the boest in the commune?
<p>

[1/12, 8:53 AM] Ety: There is no WiFi coffee spot in anjiro
<p>

[1/12, 8:54 AM] J: How about the spot where the coverage is best in the commune?
<p>

[1/12, 8:56 AM] Ety: My phone says I have 4G. It still does not allow me to open web pages. I've tried a lot of things for the past few months already for personal internet needs and only in Moramanga can I connect.
<p>

[1/12, 9:00 AM] J: Have talk to the mayor or your counterpart about the place where you can open email in the commune?
<p>

[1/12, 9:01 AM] Ety: Why email? The VRG is online
<p>

[1/12, 9:01 AM] J: I am thing that if you can open email box you can open VRG.
<p>

[1/12, 9:04 AM] Ety: Perhaps. But the sure access is in Moramanga, so if you want me to submit to the VRG, that is where I will have to be.
<p>

[1/12, 9:11 AM] J: Do you want to try to find a solution locally first and then we will see this option of going to Moramanga?
<p>

[1/12, 9:11 AM] Ety: I'll look for a solution here and get back to you. I may not know till tomorrow or the day after
<p>

[1/12, 9:14 AM] J: Thank you for your willingness to find a local solution for that. Can I call you back this afternoon to get update?
<p>

[1/12, 9:15 AM] Ety: Yes fine to call this afternoon
<p>

[1/12, 9:16 AM] J: Misaotra betsak Eric
<p>

[1/12, 9:17 AM] Ety: Tsy Missy fisoaran!
<p>

[1/12, 11:03 AM] Ety: Hello, I can confirm that there are no WiFi cafes in Anjiro, and that even in a spot with 4g (all bars of reception) my Telma sim card will not allow me to connect to the VRG portal.
<p>

[1/12, 11:15 AM] J: Thank you Eric for the confirmation.
<p>

[1/12, 11:16 AM] J: How often do you plan to go to your banking town per month?
<p>

[1/12, 11:17 AM] Ety: 2x a month (I was sick with covid and quarantined for all the beginning of January so I did not go Earlier )
<p>

[1/12, 11:18 AM] Ety: I can absolutely go a 3rd time if its reimbursed by PC
<p>

[1/12, 11:29 AM] J: You said this month you did not go yet to your banking town?
<p>

[1/12, 11:36 AM] Ety: No, I did go, on the 10th (the first day out of quarantine) and the WiFi cafe I use was closed
<p>

[1/12, 12:38 PM] J: You plan to go to your banking twice a month. You think that if you go to your banking town 3 times this due to VRG report your living allowance is not enough to do this one extra trip to your banking town. I am asking that to gather information before I discuss this situation with the admin team.
<p>

[1/12, 12:40 PM] Ety: That is correct, I only have 100k left even though I spent most of the month already in quarantine. I've been dipping into the 400 000 "emergency " fund because I don't have enough most of the time. And I am saving up for when I have to replace my gas soon (which will cost at least 100k more)
<p>

[1/12, 12:41 PM] Ety: So even a small trip is not trivial
<p>

[1/12, 12:43 PM] J: How much is the taxi brousse fare from your site to banking town?
<p>

[1/12, 12:44 PM] Ety: 10 k round trip. I would also need to buy coffee or something at the cafe to justify staying there so that would be another 5 - 10 k for a total of 20 000 are just to do VRG work
<p>

[1/12, 1:07 PM] J: i think transportation is already included in your leaving allowance and I have to gather all information to tell to the admin team for the reimbursement. I think there is 24 000 Ar for transporation in your living allowance. Sending VRG report on time is among the task that we ask PCV working on the field to do. I wish we could push the due date but the VRG portal will not allow us to do that. The VRG portal will be no longer accessible by PCV after january 15 th, to report activities for Q 1. What would be your plan B if the reimbursement would not be approved?
<p>

[1/12, 1:09 PM] Ety: Plan b would be to report my activities in Q2
<p>

[1/12, 1:12 PM] J: Are you aware of that not sending VRG or other activites which are schedule to be reported on a pre-determined period of time may be subject of discplinary action?
<p>

[1/12, 1:13 PM] Ety: No, that was never explained by Keith.
<p>

[1/12, 1:13 PM] Ety: And AGAIN, I am happy to go to Moramanga, I just can't afford it. The price of the TB [taxi-bus] has alredy risen since I've been here
<p>

[1/12, 1:22 PM] J: I am glad to hear that and we are here to spport you to report on time your VRG. So do you think that 24 000 Ar is not enough for PCV to cover their transportation in general?
<p>

[1/12, 1:27 PM] Ety: No it is not enough money. Our stipends are very out of date price wise. Every PCV I have spoken to is having trouble making ends meet. Looking at a pre-covid document, I saw that the price of transit went up about 43% for travel from Moramanga to Tana. I suspect there is a similar increase on local routes.
<p>

[1/12, 1:30 PM] J: How would you do for Q 2 to avoid that situation?
<p>

[1/12, 1:31 PM] Ety: I would not travel to Moramanga on a Tuesday when the coffee shop is closed. This is not something that will happen again.
<p>

[1/12, 1:32 PM] J: Have you tried to find other places in Moramanga where you can have access to internet?
<p>

[1/12, 1:36 PM] Ety: No I have not since the cafe worked. But I know that 2 hotels have WiFi. whether they would let me use it or not is an open question since I would not be a guest at the hotel.
<p>

[1/12, 1:42 PM] Ety: I just want to make it absolutely clear once more: I am not refusing to report on the VRG, I am just explaining why it is very difficult to do so before this Sunday.
<p>

[1/12, 1:43 PM] J: Between Tana and Tamatave, Moramanga is the biggest city on RN 2. I am sure that there are several wifi coffee there. Thank you again for your answers and time. I will consult the admin team and get back to you. But for confirmation, you cannot report Q 1 on time if you will not be reimbursed for the trip in Moramanga this week.
<p>

[1/12, 1:45 PM] Ety: That is correct: there is no problem with WiFi access in Moramanga (except on Tuesdays) and I cannot submit Q1 VRG without being there, and I can't afford to go there again before Sunday or else I will be over budget again (and suffer accordingly)
<p>

[1/12, 3:15 PM] J: I had a discussion with the DMO [in charge of mail and funds and stuff… unkown acronym] and you are authorized to use the amount you need from your float fund (400 000 Ar) but you have to reimburse it when you get your living allowance. But trip to go to Moramanga will be reimbursed as itself. I hope that help you.
<p>

[1/12, 3:16 PM] Ety: Okay so to confirm, I will be reimbursed for the cost of travel to and from Moramanga.
<p>

[1/12, 3:16 PM] Ety: Thank you
<p>

[1/12, 3:29 PM] J: No, The trip is not reimbursed but you can use your float fund to go there and refill you float fund when you will get your living allowance. THE TRIP WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED.
<p>

[1/12, 3:29 PM] J: I am sorry I forgot the not in the previous message.
<p>

[1/12, 3:32 PM] Ety: Hi J, could you please explain why the trip won't be reimbursed? To reiterate what I said above, I can't afford extra trips to my banking town without Reimbursement. So unless I get reimbursed I Can't complete the VRG for Q1. It seems like this is a routine case of PC required transport and so should be reimbursed.
<p>

[1/12, 3:38 PM] J: In my understanding as you have float fund in case you need money to use at site for this case. You get authorization to use it instead of getting reimbursed because you have transport included in your living allowance.
<p>

[1/12, 3:42 PM] Ety: As I said before the transport budget is not enough to cover extra trips like the one you are asking me to take. The transport allowance is out of date and no longer relevant to our conversation. whether I use this month's money or next month's money it is the same if it comes out of the float fund since will have to repay it out of my living allowance. In short : if I travel 3 times this month, I can only travel once next month, or only three times in the coming 2 months.
<p>

[1/12, 3:46 PM] J: I see. Could you communicate that point directly to DMO? Then she will find what we can do because this is a good point that you can directly communicate with her.
<p>

[1/12, 3:46 PM] Ety: Okay that sounds like a good idea. I should reach out to Deborah about the reimbursement?
<p>

[1/12, 3:48 PM] J: Yes, I do advise you to reach out to her. You can copy Amanda and Hoby if you will.
<p>

[1/12, 3:48 PM] J: Thank you Eric for your time and sharing your thoughts. Mazotoa!
<p>

[1/12, 3:48 PM] Ety: Okay, I'll reach out to Deborah. Unfortunately I can only communicate via what's app so I can't copy anyone on the conversation
<p>

[1/12, 3:49 PM] J: That works. We remain available in case you still need support.
<p>


Sorry if that gave you second hand trauma. The case is still unresolved. It is like this for most of the interactions other volunteers have with the PC as well, where somewhere, something goes south and you just can’t quite pinpoint it till it is far too late and you feel like you are on the wrong side of a two way mirror screaming that you have no idea who did it! That you did not even know that there was an “it” at all! And that if you just forget I even mentionned reimbursement I will do anything you ask!
<p>

Whew. All clear till close of Q2.
<p>

Some may ask if I am OK for money. I am. I absolutely am: I can access my American funds, and a few hundred dollars will double my yearly stipend. My reason for subjecting myself to above text-based mental mud wrestling lies in the principle of the matter. One should not need to be independently wealthy to volunteer in the Peace Corps; currently our stipend reflects pre-covid (2019) prices and inflation is acute here. We are likely working with 40% less than our pre-pandemic peers.
<p>
And I am serious about my budget, and frugal. I do not buy meat or coffee, survive exclusively on beans, and do not heat up my water on the gas stove (propane being wildly expensive here) but instead warm it in the sun even though it is currently the rainy season.But hard part has never been the frugality, that I enjoy. No the hard part is interacting with the millstones of government: they grind infinitely slow, they grind infinitely fine, and they happen to be grinding me.
<p>

On my drive back from the alluded to trip to Moramanga (where the Golden Cock coffe shop closes on a Tuesday) we stopped at a gas station to load up close to 40 jerrycans that used to contain cooking oil. They were now filled with a pink liquid that I can only assume to be gasoline (what other liquids do you buy by the cubic yard at a gas station?). I knew something bad was going to happen so I made an I-told-you-so note on my phone, but put all bad thoughts out of my head to enjoy the company I was wedged between and the scenery from smack dab in the middle of the 32 people on the bus (a Mercedes sprinter van). While we were tailgating a tanker truck carrying gas (flamable/no smoking written in big red letters) our driver tapped the brakes to avoid an unwanted coupling of our front fender and their cargo, scooted all passengers a few inces forwards, and sent one of the cooking-oil-cum-gasoline carrying vessels flying into the truck ahead. No harm done. The jerrycan was swiftly reuninted with its peers and we continued home with no further incidents.
<p>

On the same trip lots of young children were also hitchiking on that taxi: they were going home from school and the driver was kind enough to let them on; even if no passengers were crowded out that still represented 15K ar of charitable transportation, a non negligable sum. Educating the next generation: it takes a village!
<p>
In all honesty, I like the excitement of a trip to Moramanga, its a city that feels like a set piece for a spaghetti western, dust and mud and beer and men (soldiers) with guns crossing the street between a constant stream of pedi-cabs. There is food made with care, and a market full of 7 types of mangoes, dried salted fish, and everything you could ever need made out of wicker. There is a post
<p>
office that I pick up my magazine subscription from (box 45 see below), and back streets that lead into miles of shanty lined back alleys. There are independence war monuments and busses that can take you anywhere (if you have time). I just would need a bit more of a travel budget that is all.
<p>

Also, the full moon is so bright here that the rooster spend all nigh cock-a-doodle-oo-ing as if it were dawn. You could easily go out and about with no flashlight (but I was bedridden with covid, and the cock crowing made starring apearances in my fever dreams). Since there are absolutely no streetlights very few people venture out of doors after dark and so I am aiming to go for a night stroll one of these days and see if I can spot nocturnal animals or watch torrential rain carve out canyons into the clay road.
<p>

I would also like to update you with regards to my mailing address if you would like to send me a postcard I promise to respond! I am entertaining snail mail correspondance with two people already (though they might not yet know it because the mail truly snails) and would be delighted to treat you to my wit in a more intamate manner!

    Dear Friends, dry and wet,
<p>

I only recently made it back to my cozy little home after spending close to 10 days on the road due to climactic conditions precluding travel, and so, writing. 
<p>
A cyclone, which I have been erroneously referring to as a hurricane enough times to make my colleague Michelle cross with me, bore down on the island a fortnight ago submerging villages, crops, people, and roads. I happened to decide to go pay a visit to other colleagues “down south” in the Ambostra region (pronounced Amboos), and on the first afternoon there received a security update from the PC requesting that all of us STANDFAST and not leave, neither our sites nor even our houses, unless absolutely necessary. Oops.
<p>
Also, cryptically: "do not walk in puddles". A tall order in a hur- cyclone.
<p>
So I spent a damp week on the left side of the bed of someone who only a few months ago was a complete stranger and I think we are better friends for the experience.
<p>

A few vignettes from the stay:
<p>

It was muddy, very very muddy. Are mud pits puddles? Muddy enough to cover you from head to toe, muddy enough to sink into, religiously muddy. Mud, watery in ruts; mud like glue up to your knees; mud red and brown.</br>
I washed my single pair of pants (as I was only planning on being away 4 days) three times on this trip, my shorts: twice. I also invested in flip flops that have the crest of the PSG (soccer/football club which trained not far from my highschool) and say “heureux” (happy) on the thong. These were needed since my other shoes started to take on water and could not dry in the humid climate brought on by a hurri- cyclone. The drawback with the ‘flops is that they tend to get yanked off my feet and sucked into deep puddles more often than not. Then you have to wallow around barefoot till you can locate the particular spot in the quagmire that it is to be freed from. Mud Pollocked up my back to my head. You have to walk very carefully in flip-flops. 
<p>

My colleague lives in two very cute little bungalows that face each other across a concrete patio two young girls come to make chalk drawings on when the rain lets up. The north structure houses the pepto-pink kitchen and the living room, as well as the music room. The south fits the bed. Both are about 5 by 10 feet, and one need not worry about cobwebs since our hair easily took care of that bit of cleaning.
The thatched roofs looked like the matted fur of two great beasts, crouching, facing each other headless; the constant rain dripping down each stalk of hay crating an a-harmonic pattern that mesmerized me till I smelled of wet wool. Inside the bed-bungalow, at night with the door and shutter closed, it is warm and dark as pitch. So much so that I had hallucinations and could not tell if my eyes were open or closed, and if there really was anything solid on either side of me, or if I was floating blackly in some primordial soup. It reinforced the idea of having been swallowed whole, Jonah like, and cut off from the “real world” just like the typho – cyclone did with the rest of Madagascar. It was like being outside of time, yet constantly wondering when time would catch up, heralded by the PC "all clear" (which only came after 5 of these nights of total darkness).
<p>

There were many frogs too.
<p>

There was an inland sea that formed on the rice paddies and corn fields, presided over by a massive white cross. Since I had never seen the area before it was shocking to see day after day the various terraced levels emerge as the flood receded. First the tips of 10 foot tall corn stalks, then fronds of papyrus, finally the green tufts of rice hay. The whole scene shifted from a two-tone of grey and mud, to a riot of greens over the course of the week. I expected there to be far more damage but it seemed like the rice and corn were just fine after a day or two of dipping, and in fact may have come out better from the whole ordeal fertilized with toothsome river clay, blessed by the towering religiosity. It certainly seems like the valley was fertile, since from what I read there is no fallow season, and some folks even manage three crops of rice a year. </br>
But still, being faced with the raw power of nature to completely alter its landscapes so heedlessly of the little human foibles framed all their toil in its near futility; from mud to mud.</br>
I think Chinese emperors of yore staked their divine legitimacy on their ability to tame flooding. It makes sense: controlling water on that scale, even in a little Malagasy village, is god-like when you are faced with the alternative. Fortunately the president here is not claiming a heavenly mandate, and so...
<p>
Folks in that part take the rain in stride.
<p>
In fact, once the water allowed for passage over two previously submerged bridges, the taxi-brousse that I took on my way back was well prepared for the vagaries of mud: there were 4 additional men and shovels (as opposed to the single shovel-less helper that takes fares in all other climates) who regularly hopped out to push, dig, and cajole the bus forwards through mud pits, up mud hills, and direct the fishtailing so that we stayed on the narrow (not straight). What I had not really been able to make out when the waters were higher was just how deep the ditches were on either side of the road… a false step then would have put me neck deep in floodwater (a step-in puddle?), later they provided a stronger incentive to drive cautiously than any of the anachronistic concrete signs along paved roads ever could.
<p>
Such a trip is walking-speed at best (~3 hours) but had the benefit of not being nearly as muddy for me (which I put a premium on since I had managed to score a lunch with a senior diplomat in the capital the next day and I would not be able to launder my pants in a hotel sink and have them dry in time for beet smoothies and curried cod on a chic Tana terrace).
<p>

In the velvety green hillsides I crawled out of on the way down from Fandjiana, a moderate hamlet where another volunteer teaches English, I made out numerous houseplants run wild: fiddle-figs (or something), bromeliads, and many others whose names I once knew when I crossed them putting in the 9 2 5 at weworks in a different life, but now no longer can recall.
<p>
As fog accumulates in cooler hollows, thousands of dragonflies congregate on sunny stretches of road making glorious banks to zip trough as they are wafted around the car unscathed.
<p>

Once I reached tarmac the drive back north sped up, but lost much in comfort since the driver and other front seat passenger I was seated between (who was tossing candy wrappers out the window for all 10 hours) started singing Adventist hymns, lending their dulcet tones to the car’s shrilly over-tuned sound system in a hellish stereo. To wit: one man’s heaven…
<p>
I took advantage of a stop where the driver exited to go yell at a beggar woman with no feet huddled on the sidewalk just where he wanted — needed— to park the van to lower the volume and glowed in the relative quiet for close to an hour before he sent it back past 11 for a particularly spiritual bop. To make matters worse, the driver, despite attempting to be faster than everyone else on the road, wrongly felt the need to come to a complete stop for every pot hole, and showed no manly courage in passing. Each attempt resulted in 10 to 15 excruciating minutes of tailgating a soot belching lorry at 5 miles an hour on an uphill when far lesser vehicles with superior pilots shot around us. In fact, I though one of those trucks we were passing was concealing a oil-derrick on fire it was so blackly smoky. 
<p>
My moral to you is thus: do not sit up front, the lack of control is less grating when you don’t have a view.
<p>


When I finally made it back to my house much had grown: cucumbers and mold. The mold, though carpeting, I dealt with. The cucumbers I ate, and gave a sample to two itinerant saleswomen who kindly bring me produce. They have been raving about the exquisite cucurbit since, praising its gem like hue, its rustic touch, its ambrosic freshness... I handed them a few seeds and I hope that soon enough I will see a my cucumber's cousins in their baskets to accompany the bananas, greens, beans, and other sundry peppers they bring in a varying roster every other day. Similarly: patypans. Unheard of here. But soon my friends will be selling them?
<p>

Things are picking up in my gardens and the corn, though not quite elephantine, is up to my chest after I spent a few hours before my departure pinching little caterpillars to death that had snuggled up into the leaves. I think a cow may have grazed on a few stalks, but corn seems to thrive at this season and is erupting all over the place. It truly is amazing how fast some things are growing: my tomatoes are grotesquely leafy, almost malignant, and shooting out alternate shafts as thick as my wrists. I have to lop off half of what they grow to keep them upright, and yet still am planning for a bumper harvest that I can spread throughout town (with novel breeds of tom. not seen here in generations, if ever). Other things, like pumpkins, seem less keen on the daily dance between deluge and laser-bright sun. I’ll figure it out soon enough.
<p>

But the best thing about being home? I can sleep with all the windows open to the moonlight, breeze, and on the right side of the bed.
<p>

With much love,
<p>

<p>
  Hello and Happy February!
<p>
Valentines day!
<p>
I love the summer :)
<p>

Some of the past few letters I have sent your way focused more on travel, bureaucracy and the irritants that those can be. It's a purge for me to put int in bits and force someone to read it; it takes away the pain, removes the bad humors and sick blood like a leech. So thank you for being my leech.
<p>
In recognition of that I hope to send something slightly more pleasant this time, a little description of my garden, which I use to soothe myself, and is the ostensible reason I am here in Madagascar. Perhaps I can share with you some of the beauty that I find there, perhaps from afar it will even soothe you too.
<p>

Currently I am in charge of two little plots of land. The first, most fruitful and beloved lies sandwiched between my house and fence, about 5 feet wide and 20 long. I first started scratching away at the dirt when I arrived at my site in November (I had to check a calendar to get that, hard to believe it is February already!) and at that point one of the neighbors who was mourning the recent death of his father (or grandfather, or great uncle twice removed, along with several hundred other mourners paying their respects and wake-ing through the night) said that the tany (soil) was ratsy (sub-optimal). Perhaps. It did serve as the threshold of the previous occupants of (now) my house. Solid stuff that slicks of torrential rain and bears the black skid marks of tired vehicles that drive on it. If you build a campfire on it you would have a patch of brick beneath, no refining of the ore needed. In fact, that plot had both the appearance and fertility of said b. as there are no weeds growing; it would probably take a century for the conquering roots of some adventuresome tree to be covered, and even then, in the lushness of post human-piter-patering, the paths of this land will lie under sparser greenery than the non-trampled periphery.
<p>

But clay can be so fertile in the right conditions! Whole civilizations were built on the agriculture unfurling sun-wards from clay. The nano-scopic mineral structure of it is such that roots can strip essential foods and chemicals from it with greater ease, and in the right conditions water seeps into delicately constructed pores thus remaining available far longer than it would in other, sandier soils where all would flow down, away, to the sea.
<p>
This now red and bleeding island was once host to such luxuriant primary forests such that the first humans to set foot on the shore mush have been swallowed into the shimmering green infinity, perhaps still influencing their natural perception. Infinite nature, infinite resources, infinite stews of corn cooked on infinite charcoal. Not so.
<p>
Incidentally, the conditions in which hard packed clay can support a fruitful garden are the same as those of a climax forest. Add lots of dead leaves, charcoal, green stuff, droppings, root hairs, fluff up the ground (like lemur-moles, and worms would have done), and presto: plants.
<p>

Starting from a barren plat is now revealing a very welcome contrast from my lower garden: there are no weeds. There were no weed, hence no weed seeds awaiting freshly turned soil; when I amended and irrigated the clay with the sweat of my brow, only my seeds sprouted, no wild oats here. 
<p>

For those of you planning on converting a nearby parking lot or other hard packed barren space to food production, the recipe for good dirt, as I made it follows. Firstly: loosen as deep as possible the dirt, even a centimeter. The new texture will prevent rain from running off as quickly and thus will allow it to seep in deeper, making the clay more workable in future efforts. If needed water the surface. Use whatever water you have at hand, I chose to use my water, which had the additional benefit of injecting large amounts of nitrogen (an essential plant nutrient many lack and cannot produce themselves) in to the ground for later use. Second, dig down deeper and add sand collected from the river bed till it feels right. Soil nomenclature says this is a type of loam and that sounds fertile to me. Then, add charcoal. This is perhaps the most important part to add: long release fertility of the P and K variety, water retention, carbon sequestration and so forth. I think Mayans had a good millennia run or so by adding this “terra preta” or bio-char in similar (but inverted) latitudes. Top off with a dusting of local dung, a couple gunny sacks of rice hulls, and layer your cheeze-puff-orange dirt on top, mulch, and let sit for a week or so. If you have compost, slather on generously. Plant a few seeds and then in a month or two of sunshine you are meeting your dietary needs! With sunlight, CO2 form the air, and the genetics miraculously bestowed by Nature, painstakingly pruned by generations of seed keepers, and preserved by Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds (perhaps they can sponsor next season’s plantings): food to sustain and start the cycle afresh. All in a little plot I stare at for hours. I think the bushes of basil are spreading frivolous smells that are seeping into my brain. Lush Lush Lush.This old body is getting what it needs, from my little walled garden, food and air and green light. I planted some wildflower seeds on the other side, and hope passiflora creepers will blot out the rest, making a throbbing green cocoon too keep out the smoke and wailing of my young neigbours.
<p>

Someone gave me a chicken, did I tell you that? Green tail-feathers, and small, triangular russet bordered ones on her back. Quite a beautiful bird, with an inquisitive ever pecking head, intended as a snack. I set her free since she was interfering with my garden, and I care about that food more. She still drops by from time to time in the hopes that I’ll throw some raw rice her way, happy bride, but I’ve learned not to: She can fly over my fence when encouraged, then refuses to leave and tramples my kale and beans. I also received an orchid offshoot which is more my speed.
<p>

Recently I met two people with their own well established gardens and I coyly buttered them up: “my, what fine plantings you have! And herbs I can scarcely imagine! I could never find such-like here in Madagascar, could I?” “would you care for a cutting?” and so now I add rosemary and thyme, fennel (“good for breastfeeding mother’s strength/health/milk”) strawberries, raspberries, citronella, passion fruit, mint, and probably a few others that I carried back from Tana in a cardboard box on the Taxi Brousse (and had to carry on a three hour stroll down the “highway” after both lanes were barred by a jack-knifed semi and disgored thousands of coconauts, but I won’t bore you with a traffic report).
<p>

When I am not collecting plants, visiting embassies and disassociating while looking at tomatoes, my job is to teach people about gardening. Since most people’s calories come from rice, the farming of which occupies most of the time and effort of 80% of Malagasy, adding less land-intensive calories and non-grain nutrients is thought to be a good thing. The farming is quite small scale and powered by animal (cow and human) labor exclusively. Labor organization is too complex to go into detail in this email. (For an apt parallel with Madagascar today, you can read "Enclosures, common rights, and women: the proletarianization of families in late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries" by Jane Humphries, in which the English agricultural landscape and organization described resembles the Malagasy one I see. There have been attempts at enclosures/land grabs, notably in 2009 by Daewoo, a ROK conglomerate, which lead to unrest and the current president A. Rajeolina's initial coup).
<p>
My method of teaching is gardening first and answering questions later. Suits me. Though one unfortunate side effect is that when I am not on site, which mainly occurs at the lower garden (at the bottom of a very very steep hill that I have fallen down several times when the clay turns to mud that, when walked on at an angle must be one of the better shoe-sole lubricants known), curious folks tend to inspect the garden themselves and walk all over my painstakingly fluffed up beds leaving their hateful footprints squarely on top of seedlings. The lower garden is more of a work in progress, given that I visit less often, the weed seeds are thriving, and cows graze on my corn. Though it must be said (And I think I have said it previously, but it bears repeating) that in this climate, with abundant rain and sun, corn, rice and other grasses do well, and so haven't suffered grazing as much as I feared. Beans grow well too, everything as if enchanted. 
<p>

Through gardening I am greening my digits, and through trade with the ambulating saleswomen, I am learning a lot about what is edible too: today they sold me leaves plucked off of pumpkins. Once stripped of their spaghetti like fibers (which I originally thought were going to be the food) they provide velvety greenery and so much surplus fiber that I rarely have felt so clean, scrubbed, inside and out. Also in their head-baskets are rotting bananas that, once stripped of their leprous, wet, black-orange mottled skins, reveal firm-yet-yielding-to-creamy berry-sweet flesh. She must know a ripening technique; I haven’t seen anyone else selling such evil looking fruit. Also ravitoot: mashed casava leaves (I add basil), and sweet potato leaves. A different leaf every day. God I’m so healthy.
<p>

And to nourish the spirit, I have started bringing flowers into my house. Previously austere, now romantic bachelor room: lilies in a plastic water bottle-vase. If you want to send a care package I could use some Swaroski.
<p>

With much love,
<p>

   <p>
   <p>
    Hello.
<p>

I am quite sorry that I haven't updated you on how I'm doing in quite some time, unfortunately I was quite <i>busy</i> with <i>work</i>. We peace corps volunteers had a two week <i>training</i> that required a further week-ish for me to recuperate from, what with various leaky walls and semi-futile fights with mold colonies (outposts of mold imperialism other volunteers are suffering from).

<p>
So, I sit once more on my (mold free) chair at my mold free table with a broom at my side to shoo away the chickens that are somehow much more prevalent in my tiny side yard now than they were prior to my <i>training</i> trip. It seems that, despite their peanut brains and close reptilian ancestors, they can somehow communicate to one another that there are plenty of tasty (moldy) ground-nuts and chamomile seedlings to go round and all you need to do is limbo under the gate right were I dug a small canal to divert afternoon rainwater away from the foundations of my house and vegetable plot. Maybe its just chicken season.
<p>

Wait a minute! Someone stole my plank! I had a plank that went across the gutter to prevent just that sort of thing! Twaz about ten inches long and covered in mud! Who would take that scrap, especially when they could see it was serving such an important purpose! Things that aren't nailed down are free game apparently :(
<p>
Upon reflection, I can hazard a guess as to where it walked off to...
<p>

During my absence, a mason took down my listing (Pisan) privy, dug an actual foundation instead of merely thinking about one, and put the whole thing back up so that now I can ablute without fear that the brick wall will crush me while nude, which I think is a lot worse than getting crushed while clothed. I gave him a few keys so that he could access my side yard to store the finishings of the old structure while he completed the new one: the corrugated roof and door frames and all that isn’t brick and mortar. I should go and pick those keys back up now that I think of it...
<p>
Well here is what musta happened: after the job was done the fellow went about and cleaned up (a rare enough event for me to commend him here as well: thank you for not leaving a <i>big pile</i> of dirt just in the path and then digging a little <i>crater</i> at the top so that there always is a <i>puddle at elevation</i> that I need to step over every time I go to the hole, like <i>some people</i> would). This included gathering every scrap and nail and item that could be put to use elsewhere or burned, which included my very serviceable chicken foil. 
<p>
In addition to payment, country carpenters and other manual laborers seem to be remunerated in left over bits and bobs to build up their personal store. Oh well. One day they may get enough to patch a roof or build a very narrow shelf.
<p>
It’s really quite a simple resolution to that mystery to be honest, but quite frustrating all the same for there are few good scraps like that one lying around, as they have all been claimed in similar circumstances, and now the chickens are here in earnest.<br>
Each time a fowl enters, in I sidle up and try to inconspicuously unlatch the gate so that when I climb out my window to shoo it away from its blind spot it will dart straight for the exit and not find itself trapped, which puts my bean vines and precious shoots at risk. A cornered chicken is very clumsy. I have gotten better at climbing out the window with a broom but I made a serviceable step with my half full charcoal sack now that I have to do it a few times a day and am lumberless. 
<p>
He did leave a short length of very valuable black tubing, and I can only assume that he feared I would come after him demanding to know what he had done with it if I did not find it either in the outhouse drain (from whence it came) or in my side yard. There is goodness among carpenters; we could have a holiday celebrating them.

<p>
When I was younger (6 months younger) I remember that I could have quite a good deal of wood scraps myself since there was so much carpenting going on during the earliest days that I was here. The people putting up my fence insisted that each end be trimmed off to make it look neat (and create value, it turns out), and there was the whole business of putting a ceiling in that left me with quite a few ends that could easily be assembled into rude steps up to a window, or a nailed to the wall to hold my divers condiments. But no. You know where those are… I even remember stacking them into a pile thinking how nice it would be to have a little store of scrap wood to start out in life, but that was November...

They even spirited away all the nails that I had bought because they must have assumed that they were left over from their work, and not something that I had purchased and was carrying around in an old covid test box. Nails, when not jealously guarded, seem to become collective property.<br>
One of my fellow volunteers recommends that I read “African Friends and Money Matters”, a book that might explain why that is (and surely extrapolates those theories beyond hardware), which I will do as soon as I can find a copy, which in these parts could be never.
<p>
It's interesting*: nails when nailed have (realized) value, but when not nailed down also have considerable (potential) value. Sometimes it feels like the latter is more important here since it confers liquidity to the nail holder. I think I'll go check all the nailed nails just in case...
<p>
<i>*when I start a sentence with "it's interesting", the above mentioned colleague knows to zone out...</i>

<p>
That same colleague also has a saying regarding construction in Madagascar, though it can be applied to most things here as well: “first thought, only thought”. (Or "best" depending on how charitable we are feeling that day).
<p>
This method of project design and management (PDM as per PC) leads to things being built, and built snappy, but often leaving a certain degree of improvisational relics embedded in the structure (such as the trap-door/large-hole in my ceiling blocked with a tarp that says, I kid you not, “elegance”) that rear their heads at critical junctures (such as during storms, when my original outhouse started its valley-floorward descent). The benefit of the jazzy approach is that anyone can add their harmonies to the confection, and after a given amount of time, the inherent flaws in the original first thought are patched up with subsequent first thoughts and buttressed by familiarity: With enough lean-tos built around a house, it can’t possibly fall over no matter how much the rain blows, and every family member can get their own kitchen nook/mud room (lit.).
<p>
In a sense, it is the most organic way to live, in structures that have grown with you and settled around your life; like a desire path across a lawn, it may look unkempt but is the most democratic and ecological form of design; to wit: I have vernal ecosystem in the pot that catches rain in my attic (which I could not have placed there without the elegant hole). Heck, even <i>I</i> feel capable of throwing together a shack or something once I get my nails back: the hardest part is to <i>start</i> doing, and any performance anxiety I may have is soothed by the abundance of crumbling <i>first thoughts</i>.

<p>
Other than that, folks have been sending their cows to graze on my lower garden’s corn stalks and that has left me fairly dis-inclined to do much down there till I can erect a fence (whose design I am thinking far too hard about). But where will I find any wood or bamboo to make one, it being spoken for and jealously guarded.

<p>
Until next time,

<p>
Kind regards,
<p>
